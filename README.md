# HUMANAV – Conference Paper Supplementary Materials

This repository will host the full prompt, constraints, and supplementary materials referenced in the HUMANAV manuscript (conference version)

The goal of this work is to explore the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate logic-based navigation constraints using Answer Set Programming (ASP), enabling human-like semantic navigation in autonomous driving.

📦 Contents:
- Full prompt used for LLM interaction
- DLV code for intrinsic traffic rules
- LLM-generated ASP constraints for each experiment

🛠️ Status: Materials will be uploaded "soon"

Thank you for your understanding
